=========================
Using reclass with Puppet
=========================

Quick start
-----------
The following steps should get you up and running quickly with |reclass| and
`Puppet`_. You will need to decide for yourself where to put your |reclass|
inventory. This could be ``/etc/reclass`` (the default), or
``/etc/puppet/reclass``. The following shall assume the latter.

Or you can also just look into ``./examples/puppet`` of your |reclass|
checkout (``/usr/share/doc/examples/puppet`` on Debian-systems), where the
following steps have already been prepared.

/…/reclass refers to the location of your |reclass| checkout.
